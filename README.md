## What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.

- **HyperText** → Refers to text that links to other documents (via hyperlinks).
- **Markup Language** → Uses tags (like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`) to describe the structure and meaning of content.

👉 Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage — it defines what elements exist (headings, paragraphs, images, forms, buttons), but not how they look (that’s handled by CSS) or how they behave (that’s handled by JavaScript).

#### 🏗️ Basic Structure of an HTML Document
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### 🚀 Why HTML is Important

- **🌍 Universal:** Every website uses it.
- **🏗️ Foundation:** Works with CSS (style) + JS (behavior).
- **📱 Responsive Web:** Works with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.
- **♿ Accessibility:** Provides semantic meaning (like `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to help screen readers and SEO.
